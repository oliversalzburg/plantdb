# Getting Started for Developers

The developer guide is still pending until the PlantDB specification has matured further.

For the time being, you can refer to the documentation of [libplantdb](../reference/libplantdb/README.md), a JavaScript library to interact with PlantDB data. This library also powers the [PlantDB Playground](./playground.md).

You might also want to check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/plantdb).
