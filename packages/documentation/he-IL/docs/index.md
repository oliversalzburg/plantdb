# PlantDB Documentation

PlantDB is a way to keep track of everything relating to your plants, and preserving that data to be useful without PlantDB.

PlantDB is not primarily a single application. It is a concept of how to record data about plants so that it can be useful for longer than any single application would be maintainable reasonably.

Today, many inexpensive plant care solutions exist, but users usually do not get access to their data in a way that would be useful long-term.

PlantDB is an attempt to solve all of that. Keep you in power of your data, and have some fun with it.
