# Event types

PlantDB does not dictate the names of any event types or the language you record them in. It only cares about you being consistent.

!!! tip

    Use the auto-complete features of the application you use to maintain your log.

However, a certain set of event types has a specific meaning to PlantDB. So it helps if you align your own events along those lines. These event types are:

| Type             | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
